## Dataset

We provide a sample dataset for training and testing the Malware Detection software. The dataset is available in the `data` directory. You can replace it with your own dataset if needed.

## Machine Learning Models

This software supports multiple machine learning classifiers, allowing you to experiment and choose the best-performing model for your specific use case. You can configure the choice of classifiers in the training script.

## Results

After training and testing your model, you can find accuracy metrics and other evaluation results in the output directory. These results will help you assess the performance of your malware detection model.
